This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and trying to render items with dynamic height.  If you don't set the `estimatedItemSize` prop or set it too low, it can lead to inaccurate layout calculations and performance issues. The list might not scroll smoothly or display items correctly, particularly when dealing with varying content heights.
