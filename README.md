This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when handling items with dynamic heights. The `dynamicHeightBug.js` file showcases the problem, where incorrect rendering and jerky scrolling occur due to missing or insufficient `estimatedItemSize` prop.  The solution, provided in `dynamicHeightSolution.js`, illustrates how to fix this by setting an appropriate `estimatedItemSize` based on average item height or using a more sophisticated approach to measure item heights.
